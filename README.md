# ANDREW THE CODER

## just my personal website and blog using Astro.

Building in public. I have a GitHub action that deploys
the site to my Linode server on every push (to the main repo).

If you have any suggestions, and especially if you want to
contribute with a blog post, feel free to have a look at the
blog that is there and send a PR with your contribution!
